The comma-separated value format contains the following columns:

* OMIM ID The OMIM identifier
* OMIM Record The allelic variant record number
* UniProt/SwissProt accession The accession number in
  SwissProt. Note that it is possible for more than one accession
  number to match the same OMIM record. In this case the data will
  appear again for each SwissProt accession. It is of course
  possible that the residue numbering may be different with
  respect to different SwissProt entries. One SwissProt accession
  may also link to more than one OMIM entry, though it is unlikely
  that there will be more than one OMIM entry with allelic
  variation information.
* Native residue The unmutated (native) amino acid from OMIM
* Residue number This is our corrected residue number with respect
  to the SwissProt entry. This should only be trusted of the Valid
  field (see below) is 't' or, at your discretion, '?'.
* Mutant residue The mutated amino acid from OMIM
* Valid Validation status: 't' indicates that the Residue number
  is definitely correct; 'f' indicates that the Residue number is
  definitely wrong - we were unable to find the native residues at
  the correct locations even when applying an offset; '?'
  indicates that the Residue number is 'probably correct' (see
  above).
* OMIM Residue number This is the residue number provided in the
  OMIM record.
