@ciall.sh - check in all Perl scripts
build.sh - main shell script to run the required programs:
   parseomim.pl      - Grab mutations from OMIM into the database
   ProcessSProt.pl   - Grab OMIM links from SwissProt
   indexfasta.pl     - Index FASTA for rapid lookup
   wrapvalidate.pl   - Validate each entry in the database by calling:
      validate.pl    - Validates the residue numbers of an entry
   update_resnums.pl - Updates the residue numbers in the database
   setdate.pl        - Puts the date in a file
getfasta.pl - Utility to grab a FASTA entry from th indexed file
getomim.pl  - Utility to grab a mutation set from the database

omim.pl - CGI script to access database
stats.pl - CGI script to access stats from database

Programs work as follows:

parseomim.pl
------------
*RECORD* marks the start of each record which is split into *FIELD*s
The *FIELD* keyword is followed by a type. These data are stored
for a record at a time. The accession is extracted from the NO *FIELD*
and the mutation data are extracted from the AV *FIELD*s

The mutation data are validated (i.e. mutated from a valid AA to a 
valid AA - not DEL, INS, etc.) and written as tab-delimited data for 
loading into the 'omim_mutant' d/b table

At the same time, the descriptions are stored into a separate hash.
After the omim_mutant data have been written, the 'omim_descriptions'
table is also written as tab-delimited data.


ProcessSProt.pl
---------------
This runs through the SwissProt file. For each record, the ID, set
of ACs, the date (DT), sequence and DR (database crosslinks) fields
are extracted. From DR, the PDB and OMIM cross references are stored.
The results are simply dumped as a tab-delimited data table in the
form of AC/OMIM tuples which are loaded into the 'swsomim' table.

Currently this is done only for the primary accession. It might be
a good idea to do it for all accessions?

N.B. Since 'sws_mutant' and 'sws_omim_mutant' are VIEWs on smsomim 
and omim_mutant, they will be populated at this stage.

indexfasta.pl  
-------------
This simply creates a DBM hash with offsets to each entry in the
FASTA version of SwissProt using the accession as the key.
You can then obtain a given FASTA entry using getfasta.pl

wrapvalidate.pl
---------------
validate.pl

update_resnums.pl

setdate.pl

getfasta.pl

getomim.pl
