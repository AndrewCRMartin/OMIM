#   Revision History:
#   =================
#   13.06.05 V1.0  Original
#   06.12.06 V1.1  Format of the SwissProt FASTA dump has changed. Code
#                  now checks that some sequences were found and indexed
#   30.09.08 V1.2  Dump format changed again... There was another change
#                  inbetween (more allowed ACs) which is now accounted for
#
